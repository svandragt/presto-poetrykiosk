# Poetry Kiosk for Pimoroni Presto

## Overview

A MicroPython kiosk app for the Pimoroni Presto that displays a looping “slide” consisting of a photo with a poem overlaid. The app shuffles the poem order once on boot (deterministic seed during development), fades in from black into the first slide, displays it for a fixed duration, then fades out to black and advances.
